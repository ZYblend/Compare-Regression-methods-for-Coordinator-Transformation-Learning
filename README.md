## Compare-Regression-methods-for-Coordinator-Transformation-Learning

### Background
<ol>
<li> Given camera with unknown parameter, it is impossible to use traditional camera calibration to connstruct coordinator transoformation matrix.</li>
<li> Single camera source, tradictional depth estimation methods depending on multiple sources of imaging cannot work. </li>
</ol>
    
### Goal
Learn coordinator transformation function between image coordinator and world coordinator.
### Motivation 
We observed underlying quadratic relationship between nomallized image coordinates and nomallized GPS distance between camera and object.
### Methods
we will compare below methods:
<ol>
<li>Gaussian Process Regression</li>
<li>Kernel Regression with Quadratic Kernel</li>
<li>Neural Network</li>   
</ol>
