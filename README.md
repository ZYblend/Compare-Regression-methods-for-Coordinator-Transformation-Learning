## Compare-Regression-methods-for-Coordinator-Transformation-Learning

### Background
- Given camera with unknown parameter, it is impossible to use traditional camera calibration to connstruct coordinator transoformation matrix.
- Single camera source, tradictional depth estimation methods depending on multiple sources of imaging cannot work. 
    
### Goal
Learn coordinator transformation function between image coordinator and world coordinator.
### Motivation 
We observed underlying quadratic relationship between nomallized image coordinates and nomallized GPS distance between camera and object.
### Methods
we will compare below methods:
- Gaussian Process Regression (**GPR**)
- Kernel Regression with Quadratic Kernel (**Qua**)
- Neural Network (**NN**)

### Results
- comparison on training dataset:<br>

- comparison on testing dataset: <br>
